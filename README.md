# Mongo Street Journal ðŸ“° 
## Overview

Mongo Street Journal is an app that scrapes news articles from the Wall Street Journal website and allows the reader to save interesting articles and leave notes on them. Happy reading!

### How does it work?

When the studious user enters the app, if no articles are scraped then he or she has to press the button to scrape articles. If articles already exist, then the user can delete all of them at the bottom and re-scrape. 

Once the user has the articles desired, he or she can then save an article, which will then allow the user to add notes, and subsequently delete them.

### Future Functionality

* Show more than the most recent note
* Refresh automatically once scrape is complete
* Individual logins

### Built With:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Materialize
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Various NPM Packages
* Heroku
